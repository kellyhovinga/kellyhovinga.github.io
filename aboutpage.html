				<h2>Statement</h2>
				<p id="related" class="about">
				"Artwork by nature is a transitive medium. It is both an expression of the artist's emotions and an expression of reality on a conceptual level. Most interestingly, a single piece of artwork can mean an infinite number of things to an infinite number of people, because the emotions a picture evokes and the thoughts associated are completely internal. Unlike a book or a movie, a picture does not dictate how the viewer is supposed to feel, but instead allows them to find their own meaning. Much of the artwork Ashley creates evokes complex emotions, but the viewer is left to their own devices to decide how those emotions fit into their world view."</p>
